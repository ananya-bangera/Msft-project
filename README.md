## 💭Problem Statement
Develop a browser-based application or a native mobile application to demonstrate application of Face Recognition technology in the area of smart advertising.

## 📰Description
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      This mobile application will act as a platform for the companies to utilise smart advertising techniques to analyse and improve their advertisements based on user inputs. 
      The generalised data will help them to get a clear idea of places where work is needed. 
      This will help them to make their advertisements more engaging thereby ensuring a better and effective reach of their advertisement. 
      The focus is on providing overall suggestions as in features liked by most of the users and places where improvement is required.
    <br>
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>   
    The Flutter-based app has two access levels :
    <ol>
    <li>Company</li>
    <li>User</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1. Company</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The companies can post the videos to promote their products</li>
    <li>The analysis of data i.e of emotions of users will be tracked via an <strong>Emotion Detection System</strong> at various timestamps of the advertisement.</li>
    <li>Generalised data will be sent to the respective company’s Dashboard wherein a complete analysis will be displayed.</li>
    <li>This app will serve as a survey with input being fed by the recognition system which can further be helpful for the marketing team of the company to categorize the 
    features to be ameliorated and those to be abolished.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>2. User</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The users can view the videos posted by the companies</li>
    <li>The rewards will be provided by the company to the users depending on the  advertisements watched by them which can be redeemed</li>
    <li>Also apart from these rewards user ranking will be provided on basis of the number of advertisements watched</li>
    <li>The interface provides users with a gamified environment </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Business Potential</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>The companies can be charged some fee for using the platform. </li>
    <li>The users can be provided coins, coupons, and discounts by the participating companies</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
